### Cleanup.
#
# Triggered by a trap to clean on unexpected exit as well.

function cleanup {
  if [ -n ${REPORT} ]; then
    rm -f ${REPORT}

}
trap cleanup 0


### Options parsing.

for OPTION in "$@"; do
  case "${OPTION}" in
    '-h'|'--help')
      usage
      exit 0
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Unknown option '${OPTION}'. Try ${0} --help."

### Preparations.

# We write into a report file to allow us to a) collect multiple findings and
# b) evaluate the collection before exiting.
REPORT=$(mktemp)
export REPORT

if [ -f .git ]; then
  IS_GIT='true'

### Auxilliary functions.

# Report an error.
function e {
  echo "Error: ${1}" >> ${REPORT}
}

# Report a warning.
function w {
  echo "Warning: ${1}" >> ${REPORT}
}


### .gitignore

# .gitignore should contain a minimum set of entries.
${CAT} .gitignore | grep -q '^/translations/\*$' || \
  e "line with '/translations/*' missing in .gitignore."
${CAT} .gitignore | grep -q '^!/translations/index\.php$' || \

${CAT} .gitignore | grep -q "^$(basename $(pwd))-\\*\\.zip$" || \
  e "line with '$(basename $(pwd))-*.zip' missing in .gitignore."


### Translations stuff.
#
# Even modules not adding to the user interface have translations, e.g.
# name and description in the list of modules in backoffice.

# Note: 'grep -q .' is needed because 'git ls-files' always returns success.
${LS} translations/index.php | grep -q '.' || \
  e "file translations/index.php doesn't exist."
${LS} translations/\* | grep -vq '^translations/index\.php$' && \

### Evaluation of findings.

cat ${REPORT}

if grep -q '^Error:' ${REPORT}; then
  exit 1
else
  echo "Validation succeeded."
